Hello! This was simply a short plugin project for me, as I want to have a deeper grasp of Blender scripting and graphics programming. Running this script in Blender will allow you to create a flat star-shaped object at the location of the 3D cursor, which can then be further customized in the toolbar. Enjoy!

star_maker filename: pystar_1.py

Plugin to create a star planar mesh from the add menu in Blender.

### TO USE

File > User Preferences > Add-ons > search by "star" (or use mesh filter)

### CONTROLS

Outer radius: sets the outer radius of the star (how far the points are from the center).

Inner radius: sets the inner radius of the star (the points in between the pointy points).

Scale: sets a scale factor for both the inner and outer radius of the star at the same time. Useful for when you have a good ratio between them.

Point Count: sets the number of points on the star. Minimum value is 2, maximum is whenever your computer crashes.
